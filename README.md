# USB-Power
A small 10A USB Power-supply with monitoring and display

I would like to monitor power consumption during for instance running a Raspberry Pi or check the load curve on recharging LiPo batteries.

Hence this little project...

The core components in the design:
- LRS-50-5 Power Module
- Wemos D1 processor board
- ADS1115 ADC-module
- ACS758 Hall-based current monitor
- SSD1306; 128x32 OLED
